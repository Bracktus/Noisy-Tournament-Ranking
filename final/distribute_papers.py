"""
We want the paper distribution algo to:

- Be fast
- Avoid giving students their own paper DONE
- Prevent giving too many of one student to a specific student DONE
- Maximise information gleamed

There are n C 2 = n*(n-1) / 2. matchups.
That means if we want a complete picture we'll
have to assign each student (n - 1)/2 pairs

If we were to assign every student every matchup (exculding their own).

Then they would be assigned (n*(n-1) / 2) - (n - 1) matchups.

"make it work, make it right, make it fast"
