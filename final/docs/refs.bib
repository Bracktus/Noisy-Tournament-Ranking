	title = {A {Case} for {Ordinal} {Peer}-evaluation in {MOOCs}},
	abstract = {MOOCs have been highly successful due to the ease of disseminating information: anyone with an Internet connection can watch videos of the lectures and download study material. However, they still lag far behind conventional classrooms in one critical aspect—feedback to and evaluation of the students—due to severe mismatches in the number of students enrolled and the number of experts available. One means of performing evaluation and feedback is peer evaluation wherein the answers submitted by a student are anonymized and provided to a set of other students to evaluate. As per current peer evaluation techniques, these peer evaluators assign cardinal scores to the given solutions. In this paper, we posit an alternative approach to peer evaluation based on pairwise comparisons. We argue that such an ordinal approach is signiﬁcantly more robust to the lack of expertise of the evaluators, as compared to the conventional cardinal approaches.},

	abstract = {We propose the PeerRank method for peer assessment. This constructs a grade for an agent based on the grades proposed by the agents evaluating the agent. Since the grade of an agent is a measure of their ability to grade correctly, the PeerRank method weights grades by the grades of the grading agent. The PeerRank method also provides an incentive for agents to grade correctly. As the grades of an agent depend on the grades of the grading agents, and as these grades themselves depend on the grades of other agents, we deﬁne the PeerRank method by a ﬁxed point equation similar to the PageRank method for ranking web-pages. We identify some formal properties of the PeerRank method (for example, it satisﬁes axioms of unanimity, no dummy, no discrimination and symmetry), discuss some examples, compare with related work and evaluate the performance on some synthetic data. Our results show considerable promise, reducing the error in grade predictions by a factor of 2 or more in many cases over the natural baseline of averaging peer grades.},

	abstract = {Many scenarios in our daily life require us to infer some ranking over items or people based on limited information. In this paper, we consider two such scenarios, one for ranking student papers in massive online open courses and one for identifying the best player (or team) in sports tournaments. For the peer grading problem, we design a mechanism with a new way of matching graders to papers. This allows us to aggregate partial rankings from graders into a global one, with an accuracy rate matching the best in previous works, but with a much simpler analysis. For the winner selection problem in sports tournaments, we cast it as the well-known dueling bandit problem and identify a new measure to minimize: the number of parallel rounds, as one normally would not like a large tournament to last too long. We provide mechanisms which can determine the optimal or an almost optimal player in a small number of parallel rounds and at the same time using a small number of competitions.},

Unless you were really lucky, the results would not be acyclic, so you could not just sort the players by who beat whom. A natural objective is to ﬁnd a ranking that minimizes the number of upsets, where an upset is a pair of players where the player ranked lower on the ranking beats the player ranked higher. This is the NP-hard minimum feedback arc set (FAS) problem on tournaments. Our main result is a polynomial time approximation scheme (PTAS) for this problem. A simple weighted generalization gives a PTAS for Kemeny-Young rank aggregation.},

	abstract = {Ranking the participants of a tournament has applications in voting, paired comparisons analysis, sports and other domains. In this paper we introduce bipartite tournaments, which model situations in which two different kinds of entity compete indirectly via matches against players of the opposite kind; examples include education (students/exam questions) and solo sports (golfers/courses). In particular, we look to find rankings via chain graphs, which correspond to bipartite tournaments in which the sets of adversaries defeated by the players on one side are nested with respect to set inclusion. Tournaments of this form have a natural and appealing ranking associated with them. We apply chain editing – finding the minimum number of edge changes required to form a chain graph – as a new mechanism for tournament ranking. The properties of these rankings are investigated in a probabilistic setting, where they arise as maximum likelihood estimators, and through the axiomatic method of social choice theory. Despite some nice properties, two problems remain: an important anonymity axiom is violated, and chain editing is NP-hard. We address both issues by relaxing the minimisation constraint in chain editing, and characterise the resulting ranking methods via a greedy approximation algorithm.},

The model allows peer grader to rank a small subset of submissions that are later merged into a global ranked set of all submissions for an assignment. This global set of ranked submissions and grades produced by expert graders(instructors and/or teachers assistants) who perform absolute grading of their own small subset of the submissions, are used to interpolate a cardinal grade for each submission of an assignment but excluding the ones graded by the experts. This model will be simulated to define the values of different parameters that produces valid and reliable grades. The research will also show that the model is scalable for different size courses by examining the effort of peer graders and expert graders.},

	abstract = {MOOCs have the potential to revolutionize higher education with their wide outreach and accessibility, but they require instructors to come up with scalable alternates to traditional student evaluation. Peer grading – having students assess each other – is a promising approach to tackling the problem of evaluation at scale, since the number of ”graders” naturally scales with the number of students. However, students are not trained in grading, which means that one cannot expect the same level of grading skills as in traditional settings. Drawing on broad evidence that ordinal feedback is easier to provide and more reliable than cardinal feedback [5, 38, 29, 9], it is therefore desirable to allow peer graders to make ordinal statements (e.g. ”project X is better than project Y”) and not require them to make cardinal statements (e.g. ”project X is a B-”). Thus, in this paper we study the problem of automatically inferring student grades from ordinal peer feedback, as opposed to existing methods that require cardinal peer feedback. We formulate the ordinal peer grading problem as a type of rank aggregation problem, and explore several probabilistic models under which to estimate student grades and grader reliability. We study the applicability of these methods using peer grading data collected from a real class — with instructor and TA grades as a baseline — and demonstrate the eﬃcacy of ordinal feedback techniques in comparison to existing cardinal peer grading methods. Finally, we compare these peer-grading techniques to traditional evaluation techniques.},

Our fairness objective is to maximize the review quality of the most disadvantaged paper, in contrast to the commonly used objective of maximizing the total quality over all papers. We design an assignment algorithm based on an incremental max-ﬂow procedure that we prove is near-optimally fair. Our statistical accuracy objective is to ensure correct recovery of the papers that should be accepted. We provide a sharp minimax analysis of the accuracy of the peer-review process for a popular objective-score model as well as for a novel subjective-score model that we propose in the paper. Our analysis proves that our proposed assignment algorithm also leads to a near-optimal statistical accuracy. Finally, we design a novel experiment that allows for an objective comparison of various assignment algorithms, and overcomes the inherent diﬃculty posed by the absence of a ground truth in experiments on peer-review. The results of this experiment as well as of other experiments on synthetic and real data corroborate the theoretical guarantees of our algorithm.},
