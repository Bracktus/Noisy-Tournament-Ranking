    The refereed bradley-terry model is as follows:
    p(i: j > k) = 1/(1 + e^{gi*(wj + wk)})
    where wj and wk are the skill levels of j and k
    and gi is the grading level of i. Which is a function of wi.

    Our likelihood function will be product(p(i: j > k)) for all (i:j,k) in assignemnts
    If we take the log of this we get.
    sum(-ln(1 + e^{gi*(wj + wk)})) for all (i:j,k) in assingments
    Maximise this function to get our values for gi, wj, wk for all i,j,k.
